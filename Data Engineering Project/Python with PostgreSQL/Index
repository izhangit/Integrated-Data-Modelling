a. What is Data Model

    A Data Model is an abstract Model that organizes elements of data and standartizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

    
b. why is Data Modeling Important

    - Really Important to Oraganize Data
    - Organized data determines later data use
    - Begin prior to building out applications, business logic and analytical models
    - Iterative process

 c. Who does this type of work 

    - Data Scientist
    - Software Engineers
    - Data Engineer
    - Anyone involved in the process of using and analyzing data

d. Relational Model

    Organize data into one or more tables of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row.

   - Relational Database 
        It is a digital database based on the relational model of data ... a software system used to maintain relational database is a relatioanl database management system (RDBMS)

        - MySQL
        - PostgreSQL
        - Oracle
        - MSSQL

e. What are ACID Porperties 

        ACID

        - Atomicity
        - Consistency 
        - Isolation
        - Durability


f. Requirements

    1. PsotgreSQL
    2. Python 3.6 or later version 
    3. Jupyter Notebook
