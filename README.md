# Integrated-Data-Modelling

# Overview
  Leveraged Python and PostgreSQL to Perform data modeling, including schema design and SQL analysis. Focused on data warehouse fundamentals, transforming a 3rd Normal Form(3NF) schema into an efficient star schema. Optimized SQL queries through joins and other techniques to enhance performance.
